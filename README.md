# 📊 E‑Commerce Data Analysis Final Project

### 📌 Overview
This project is part of my data analysis portfolio.
Using SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and SQLite, I analyzed a real e‑commerce dataset (olist.db) to uncover insights that help improve business performance.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze sales trends to identify seasonality and demand patterns.
- Discover top cities with the highest customer orders.
- Evaluate payment method preferences and their impact.
- Analyze review scores to understand factors causing low satisfaction.
- Assess seller performance (top/bottom sellers, shipping efficiency).
- Explore freight charges and their relationship with customer satisfaction.

### 📂 Datasets Used
The analysis uses tables from olist.db:
olist_orders_dataset
olist_customers_dataset
olist_order_items_dataset
olist_order_reviews_dataset
olist_order_payments_dataset
olist_sellers_dataset
olist_products_dataset

### 🔧 Tech Stack

### 📌 Key Insights
📉 Certain months show declining orders → optimize campaigns during low season.
🏙️ Major sales come from a few key cities → focus logistics and marketing efforts there.
💳 A few payment methods dominate → ensure seamless experience for those.
⭐ Low review scores often correlate with longer shipping times and higher freight charges → improve logistics and pricing strategy.

### 🚀 Recommendations
- Enhance logistics efficiency to reduce shipping delays and freight costs.
- Target marketing campaigns during low-demand months.
- Provide incentives in cities with lower order volume.
- Regularly monitor seller performance and enforce quality standards.
