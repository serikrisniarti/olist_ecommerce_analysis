# 📊 E‑Commerce Data Analysis Final Project

### 📌 Overview
This project is part of my data analysis portfolio.
Using SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and SQLite, I analyzed a real e‑commerce dataset (olist.db) to uncover insights that help improve business performance.

### 🎯 Objectives
Analyze sales trends to identify seasonality and demand patterns.

Discover top cities with the highest customer orders.

Evaluate payment method preferences and their impact.

Analyze review scores to understand factors causing low satisfaction.

Assess seller performance (top/bottom sellers, shipping efficiency).

Explore freight charges and their relationship with customer satisfaction.

### 📂 Datasets Used
The analysis uses tables from foo.db:

olist_orders_dataset

olist_customers_dataset

olist_order_items_dataset

olist_order_reviews_dataset

olist_order_payments_dataset

olist_sellers_dataset

olist_products_dataset

### 🔧 Tech Stack

### 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
✅ Sales Trend: Total orders per month (line chart)

✅ Customer Orders by City: Top 5 cities with most orders (bar chart)

✅ Most Popular Payment Methods: Distribution of payment types (pie chart)

✅ Review Score Distribution: Customer satisfaction (histogram)

✅ Seller Performance: Top/bottom sellers, shipping trends (bar & line chart)

✅ Freight Charges Analysis: Correlation with price and review scores (heatmap & scatter)

✅ Weekend vs Weekday Orders: Order behavior comparison (pie chart)

### 📌 Key Insights
📉 Certain months show declining orders → optimize campaigns during low season.

🏙️ Major sales come from a few key cities → focus logistics and marketing efforts there.

💳 A few payment methods dominate → ensure seamless experience for those.

⭐ Low review scores often correlate with longer shipping times and higher freight charges → improve logistics and pricing strategy.

🚀 Recommendations
Enhance logistics efficiency to reduce shipping delays and freight costs.

Target marketing campaigns during low-demand months.

Provide incentives in cities with lower order volume.

Regularly monitor seller performance and enforce quality standards.
